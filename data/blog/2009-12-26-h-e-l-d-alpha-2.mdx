A few years ago, a small german amateur game development group called [Elitepigs](http://www.elitepigs.de) started a remake of the classic C64 &#8220;HERO&#8221; game. This game was called &#8220;H.E.L.D.&#8221; (german translation of _hero_). Last time I contributed only the level editor while jrk coded the actual game. But unfortunately the game was never finished as the game&#8217;s sourcecode got lost, so the only remaining parts of the alpha version are a compiled binary and the graphic/sound assets.

To practice and improve my XNA skills I decided to remake the remake in XNA. With permission of the original creators, I started today with the intro video (Remember: When making a game, always start with the intro and the mainmenu!). Right now I have a rough version of the original intro video implemented as well as an extention to the XNA Content Pipeline in order to process the H.E.L.D. level files.
