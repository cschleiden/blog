I still receive a lot of hits for my [earlier post](http://cschleiden.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/howto-export-excel-charts-as-pdf-to-include-in-latex-document/ "HowTo: Export Excel Charts as PDF to include in LaTeX document") about how to export Excel charts to PDF in order to include them in a LaTeX document. Various keywords also indicate that a lot of people want to kind of automate that process and export many charts at once. Luckily that is also possible now. I have not checked for the PC version yet (if you do it would be great if you could tell me in the comments or view some other [channel](http://cschleiden.wordpress.com/about/ "About") but here is how-to for Microsoft Excel 2011 for the Mac:

1. Create your charts (that step should be obvious)

2. Select all your charts (hold shift and click):
![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-19-at-2-06-42-pm.png)

3. Select `Save as Picture` from the context menu

4. Check the Box `Save each graphic as a separate file` and select format PDF:
![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-19-at-2-06-31-pm.png) 5. Enter a name. Note: The name entered here will result in Excel: a) creating a directory with the name b) saving each selected diagram with name `<entered-name>-<number>.pdf`. So for example `Charts`:
![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-19-at-2-06-20-pm.png)with the two earlier selected charts will result in:
![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen-shot-2011-08-19-at-2-07-00-pm.png)6. All selected charts will be saved and automatically cropped, ready to be included in your document.

7. This works similarly in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Powerpoint.


Have fun.
