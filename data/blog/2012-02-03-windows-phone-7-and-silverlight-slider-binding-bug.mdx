It took me about 4-5 hours today to finally recognize why one my custom controls behaved in a strange way. It is a control derived from the Silverlight slider control and I encountered strange behavior when binding the Maximum and Minimum properties. After countless checks to make sure, that my ViewModel logic was flawless I finally discovered that &#8230; the order of attributes in the xaml code \*does\* matter when binding these exact properties.

It turns out, instead of this

```xml
<Slider Name="slider" Grid.Column="1" Minimum="{Binding MinValue}" Maximum="{Binding MaxValue}" />
```

it should be this:

```xml
<Slider Name="slider" Grid.Column="1" Maximum="{Binding MaxValue}" Minimum="{Binding MinValue}" />
```
