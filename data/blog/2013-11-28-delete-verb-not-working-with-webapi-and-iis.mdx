Recently I've had a problem where a deployed WebApi service did not accept the `DELETE` verb (locally, using IISExpress it worked). The <a href="http://forums.iis.net/t/1166025.aspx" target="_blank">solution</a> was to remove the WebDAV module and handler for the specific site. So extend the web.config of the WebApi project with:

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <modules>
    <remove name="WebDAVModule" />
  </modules>
  <handlers>
    <remove name="WebDAV" />
  </handlers>
</system.webServer>
```

Then it worked just fine.
