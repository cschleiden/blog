After a number of blogs I follow switched from live spaces to wordpress.com, I also decided to give it a try. So far I really like the admin backend and the theme selector.

After a long week I just took two days off and enjoyed the beautiful weather (first sunny days in 2009), tomorrow I&#8217;ll be back working on my bachelor thesis and the coming weekend will see a new sechsta sinn team meeting.

So long.
