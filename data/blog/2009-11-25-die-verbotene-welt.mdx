Last weekend we had another [sechsta sinn](http://www.sechsta-sinn.de) development meeting in Cologne. After I finished some LUA 4 serialization code (really ugly stuff&#8230; after the project is finished I will burn this particular code file) I played a short game against our AI player on Raphael&#8217;s really beautiful _dust_ map and decided to make a panorama shot out of it. The result can be seen below:
