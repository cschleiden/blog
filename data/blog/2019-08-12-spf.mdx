Often when presenting screen designs in meetings the projector blows out highlights and small details, making it very hard to critique the overall design. If you are using a Mac you can use the awesome [SPF](https://github.com/tannerc/spf) to add a semi-transparent dark overlay over your screen. If you are on a Windows machine - or you don't want to install an app for this, and you are presenting your designs using Figma in the browser anyway - use the following bookmarklets:

Just drag them to your bookmarks bar and click to use:
