Recently my Windows Search started to misbehave. It consumed large amounts of memory and CPU time. In addition, the index (in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data) grew to several gigabytes.

To workaround that, I tried to reduce the indexed locations (Win + W, “change how windows searches”) and rebuild the index. So I changed the locations to only index Documents and hit “Rebuild”:

While this fixed the issues mentioned before, something new occurred. Suddenly, every time I tried to search for something in the search charm the computer began to freeze, keystrokes were not accepted at all or with a severe delay. The troubleshooter

did not produce any meaningful results and rebuilding the index did not help either.

It turned out, the solution is that you **have** to have your _AppData_ folder in the indexed locations. So if you have the same problem just add

> C:\Users\<user>\AppData\

back the the indexed locations, rebuild your index, and you are good to go again.
