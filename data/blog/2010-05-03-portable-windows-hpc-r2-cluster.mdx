In preparation for the two Microsoft Technology Specialist HPC exams (70-691 and 70-690) I just installed a two compute node Windows HPC environment on my Dell notebook (Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V as host):

So far everything works, the diagnostic tests were all fine and the machine is still usable (dual core, 4 GB with four virtual machines – AD/DNS, head node, and two compute nodes).
