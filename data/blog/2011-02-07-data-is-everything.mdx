  As we all know data is everything in optimizing and improving web pages. Until last week <a href="http://www.imperaonline.de/">Impera</a> lacked the functionality to display data over time. Even though we were able to show some snapshots of certain metrics (in German):

  there was no continuous tracking and measuring enabled. On Friday I finally wrote some background scripts which save certain metrics at fixed time intervals. These can then be displayed using the amazing jQuery <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/" target="_blank">flot</a> graph library as beautifully formatted graphs over time. Here you can see the average number of online players per hour (GMT+1 timezone and mostly German users from GMT+1):

I think the results are as expected with a peak during the day and a valley after 2 a.m. However, this data is only aggregated over a timespan of two and a half days. I expect the following graph to be more of interest when a few weeks of data have been captured:

Even with this little data it can be inferred, that Impera players get up earlier on Mondays than on weekends (what a surprise!).

There are a few other graphs available but more data is needed for them to be of any interest.
