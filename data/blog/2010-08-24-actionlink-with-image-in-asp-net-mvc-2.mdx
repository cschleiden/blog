title: ActionLink with Image in ASP.NET MVC 2

As far as I know, this is one of the simplest ways to insert an ActionLink into your ASP.NET MVC 2 View with an image instead of text:

<div>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>&lt;a href="&lt;%: Url.Action("Detail", new  { param1 = "blah" } )  %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;img src="../../Content/images/magnifier.png" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Any simpler solutions?
