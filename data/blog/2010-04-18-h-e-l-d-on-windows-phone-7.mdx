A while ago I posted some screenshots of a small XNA project I’ve been working on and a few minutes ago I ported this game to XNA Gamestudio 4.0 with Windows Phone 7 support.

As you can see, with no adaptations for the changed resolution and screen size the game looks weird but it is possible to run and play the game. Right now it is very laggish and definitely needs some improvements in terms of rendering speed, but hey, it’s a start.
