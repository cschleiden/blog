[Internet Explorer 9 Beta](http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/) has been released and includes a cool feature which allows you to ‘Pin’ websites to the taskbar just like regular programs:

You could, for example, pin Facebook to the taskbar to use [Jumplists](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/jump-lists) to quickly access you News or Messages:

However, with all these widescreen displays around today I like to have my taskbar on the right hand side of the screen in order to maximize my vertical screen estate.

When you drag a webpage to the taskbar with this setup it only triggers [AeroSnap](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/snap) which makes it impossible to pin websites this way:
