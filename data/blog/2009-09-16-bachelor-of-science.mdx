Yesterday I completed<img className="alignright size-full wp-image-90" title="IMG_5688_edited" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img_5688_edited.jpg" alt="IMG_5688_edited" width="195" height="130" /> the last part of my computer science (bachelor) studies at the RWTH Aachen. After I handed in my thesis last wednesday I successfully defended it on September the 15th. While I still have to wait for the final report by my supervisor, in my mind I already have completed this part of my education. Below you will find the final thesis (english) and the slides (german).
