If you try to search for a .NET topic with the new IE 9 you might run into some problems:

![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image.png)

If you put “.net” as the first keyword, IE9 thinks it's supposed to open an url instead of querying you configured search engine for it.

If you change the order of the query terms, e.g., from “.net unity” to “unity .net” it'll work just fine:

![](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/image1.png)
