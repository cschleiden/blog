Some of my side projects. Some were built to experiment with technologies I don't use in my day job, others to fill gaps in products I worked on, and some were just to build something interesting.

Back in the early 2000s I worked with some friends in Germany on a 2D RTS called _Die Verbotene Welt_. We never shipped it, but our internal versions came quite close. Including split-screen multiplayer, beginnings of networked multiplayer and various single player modes.

### Various Azure DevOps extensions

While I was working on Azure DevOps I built various extensions and published them on the marketplace. Due to lack of time and interest I've deprecated most of them. Estimate I was able to hand off to an MSFT sponsored vendor team to maintain:
