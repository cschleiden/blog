Last Friday I passed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-536&locale=en-us" target="_blank">70-536 Exam, TS: Microsoft .NET Framework &#8211; Application Development Foundation</a>. I had thought it would be much more difficult but in the end it was pretty easy (or I was just well prepared.. maybe both). Next ones will then be 70-562 and 70-564 to reach the Microsoft Certified Developer status but I think that has to wait until after the thesis.
