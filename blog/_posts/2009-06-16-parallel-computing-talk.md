About two weeks ago I spoke at the [&#8220;Project Springboard&#8221;](http://springboard.cloudapp.net/) event &#8211; a free event organized by Microsoft Student Partners for students interested in new Microsoft technologies &#8211; in the Microsoft office in Cologne about Parallel Computing. As I had only about 60 minutes available my talk was meant provide a very high-level and broad overview over the field (general parallelization, native-, and managed code). I do not know if I really accomplished that task, but the comments afterwards were quite positive. [Here](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/parallelcomputing.pdf) are most of the slides I used (small parts were borrowed from PDC presentations).
