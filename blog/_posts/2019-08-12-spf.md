Often when presenting screen designs in meetings the projector blows out highlights and small details, making it very hard to critique the overall design. If you are using a Mac you can use the awesome [SPF](https://github.com/tannerc/spf) to add a semi-transparent dark overlay over your screen. If you are on a Windows machine - or you don't want to install an app for this, and you are presenting your designs using Figma in the browser anyway - use the following bookmarklets:

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/x76lx3w1ko?fontsize=14" title="In-browser SPF" allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

Just drag them to your bookmarks bar and click to use:
