Last week I exchanged my old HTC Herald Windows Mobile device for a shiny, new Palm Pre. So far I really like the design and the usability of the OS and the hardware. Unfortunately, I have some strange calendar sync issues with appointments entered in the Pre not syncing back to my Exchange server. The Europe version of the Pre, however, is still running webOs 1.1.3 while the rest of the world is already using 1.2.1. Version 1.3.1 should be available worldwide in the next few days, so I will wait for that upgrade, see if it fixes some of my problems with this device and then I will deliver a full in depth review. Stay tuned.
